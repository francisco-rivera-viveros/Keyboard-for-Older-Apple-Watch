Hey guys!

I wanted to share something I'm really excited about: I was able to make this project come true!

Ever since I got an Apple Watch, I noticed it was kind of hard to write. I found out there was an app for the Apple Watch that gives you a keyboard, but honestly, I didn't want to pay for it.

So, I decided I wanted to build my own and upload it to the App Store for free!

Right now, I've already completed the first version (or at least, I'm calling it the first version!), and I'd like to share it here with you. I'm going to keep working on getting it uploaded to the App Store.

In the meantime, I can show you some pics of the built version working!
